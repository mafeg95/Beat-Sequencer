# Beat-Sequencer

### Background

  The Beat sequencer is an easy way for anyone to create their own beats. You simply choose a bpm, and click the keys to create your own sick beat.
  
### MVP
  * Start and pause the beat, as well as reset/clear the board
  * BPM controller
  * Board with a square grid
  * Choosing what type of beat to include in the grid
  * Toggle between on and off for the specific square on the grid
  
### Technologies

  For now, I will be using Vanilla DOM Manipulation, JavaScript, and CSS. Eventually I might need to use Canvas, and will probably need Tone.js
  
### Schedule
  * Day 1: Create basic structure of the files and construct the basic functionality of the sequencer, finish deciding on the grid scale, research tone.js and learn how to use it, begin with the entry file
  * Day 2: Continue building the interface, do some CSS to make it presentable, give it more functionality, implement the bpm. Learn how to use Tone.js
  * Day 3: Finish any MVP that I haven't finished until now, implement Tone.js in the project
